`Aug 2022 - Sep 2023`
__Senior Engineer__, [MediaTek Inc](https://i.mediatek.com/)

- Led the development and system architectural design of the ELT pipeline on GCP for the service M (a resource usage monitoring system on mobile devices), resulting in 30x increase in efficiency for identifying any abnormalities on resource, allowing different departments to quickly access a unified format of data and pinpoint any issues for mobile devices.
- Collaborated with IT department to consider infrastructure constraints for ELT pipeline, selecting appropriate tech stack, including Dash, Redis, and Drone CI, Airflow, Dataform, and developing the data-models and queries needed to create front-end dashboards and handcrafted charts to display M analyses, reducing analytics processing time of M data by 90%
- Led a technical workshop for 40 individuals in a cross-departmental training to introduce dbt, dataform and share best practices for managing large databases and setting up filter queries

`Aug 2020 - Aug 2022`
__Senior Data Scientist__, [Tresl Inc](https://www.tresl.co/)

- Developed a unified metric calculation framework for analyzing Shopify DTC e-commerce brands’ products, consolidating 70% of the metric calculation process for millions of products across hundreds of millions of customer orders, emphasizing consistency, efficiency, and scalability
- Simplified ELT pipeline using dbt, resulting in a 40% faster and more maintainable process by reducing code redundancy and streamlining metrics calculation, such as revamping customer lifetime value (CLV) calculation and modeling to ensure accurate forecasting for thousands of e-commerce brands
- Pioneered the development of "Product Journey" analysis feature in our main product Segments by building a generalized framework for mining sequential & non-sequential relationships among e-commerce products, allowing e-commerce brands to see what their customers ordered on their 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order consecutively, leading to a 40% increase in new subscription business for Tresl
- Assisted in the migration of core data infrastructure from AWS to Snowflake and from Snowflake to GCP, optimizing database settings and partitioning / clustering to increase efficiency, reducing operating costs by 80%+

`May 2019 - Aug 2020`
__Data Scientist__, [MoBagel Inc](https://mobagel.com/)

- Conducted research on state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to achieve up to 20% improved time series forecasting based on a generalized framework that can adapt to various industries including advertising, retailing, and manufacturing
- Applied predictive analysis techniques to achieve an 80% close rate for enterprise projects, including identifying correlations among products in retailing, detecting low performing ads early with a two-stage XGBoost model resulting in 30% more return on ad spend and 30% cost savings in advertising, and developing a defect factor pipeline combining Chi-square testing and machine learning algorithms for display manufacturing process
- Coordinated across departments on design and development of predictive features for internal SDKs, making it "sklearn-compatiable", managing entire projects to deliver effective client solutions

`Aug 2016 - Dec 2016`
__Big Data Analyst(Internship)__, [Delta Eletronics](https://www.deltaww.com/en-US/index)
- Searched, compared, summarized the techniques applied in metagenomic data analytics. Constructed the first NGS operational taxonomic unit(OTU) data analytical pipeline in Delta.  
- Cooperated with faculties with life science backgrounds while I had few knowledge about sequencing and metagenomics. Published a paper about performance evaluation in OTU analysis on a top-ranked journal.
